p0f-signatures
==============

Signatures for p0f (Passive OS Fingerprinter).

These signatures are regression tested using Sauce Labs and Trello and my fork of p0f.

Currently on the backburner due to issues with how travis-ci and sauce labs work. 

## TODO:
* Possibly a cloud API to do the heavy lifting?
* Multiple p0f instances at once restricted by bpf expressions?
